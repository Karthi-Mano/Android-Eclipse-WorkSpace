<h4>String:</h4>
<p>&bull;In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.</p> 
<p>&bull;The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). 
<p>&bull;A string is generally understood as a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. </p>
<p>&bull;A string may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.</p>
<p>&bull;It is possible to "add" strings together, which really means concatenation. Every programming language provides this ability in either an easier or more difficult manner.</p>
<p>&bull;String is actually a one-dimensional array of characters which is terminated by a null character '\0'.  Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.</p>
