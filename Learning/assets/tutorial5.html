<p>An operator in a programming language is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.</p>
<h4>Below is the simple flow chart for arithmetic and relational operator</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src ="topic5.png"></p>

<h3>&bull;Arithmetic Operators:</h3>
<pre>
+	Adds two operands	
-	Subtracts second operand from the first
*	Multiplies both operands
/	Divides numerator by de-numerator
%	Modulus Operator and remainder of after an integer division
++	Increment operator, increases integer value by one
--	Decrement operator, decreases integer value by one
</pre>
<h3>&bull;Relational Operators</h3>
<pre>
==	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
!=	Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
>	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
<	Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
<=	Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
</pre>
<h3>&bull;Logical Operators</h3>
<pre>
&&	Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.
||	Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.
!	Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false.
</pre>
<h3>&bull;Bitwise Operators</h3>
<pre>
&	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
|	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.
^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
~	Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.
<<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
>>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
</pre>
<h3>&bull;Assignment Operators</h3>
<pre>
=	Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
+=	Add AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand
-=	Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand
*=	Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand
/=	Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand
%=	Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand
<<=	Left shift AND assignment operator
>>=	Right shift AND assignment operator
&=	Bitwise AND assignment operator
^=	bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator
|=	bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator
</pre>
