C# also supports pointers in a limited extent. 
Declaring a Pointer type  
The general form of declaring a pointer type is as shown below        
type *variable_name; 
Where * is known as the de-reference operator. For example the following statement
int *x ; 
Declares a pointer variable x, which can hold the address of an int type. The reference operator (&) can be used to get the memory address of a variable. 
int x = 100;
The &x gives the memory address of the variable x, which we can assign to a pointer variable 
int *ptr = & x;.
Console.WriteLine((int)ptr) // Displays the memory address
Console.WriteLine(*ptr) // Displays the value at the memory address.
