<h4>Array:</h4>
<p>&bull;An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.</p>
<p>&bull;That means that, for example, five values of type int can be declared as an array without having to declare 5 different variables (each with its own identifier).</p>
<p>&bull; Instead, using an array, the five int values are stored in contiguous memory locations, and all five can be accessed using the same identifier, with the proper index.</p>

<h4>&bull;Multi-Dimensional Array</h4>
<p>&bull;The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array. A two-dimensional array is, in essence, a list of one-dimensional arrays. </p>
<p>To declare a two-dimensional integer array of size x,y, you would write something as follows:</p>
<h4>type arrayName [ x ][ y ];</h4>
