<h3>&bull; Main function syntax:</h3>
int main (int argc, char *argv[]) { body }
argc - Non-negative value representing the number of arguments passed to the program from the environment in which the program is run.
argv - Pointer to the first element of an array of pointers to null-terminated multibyte strings that represent the arguments 
passed to the program from the execution environment (argv[0] through argv[argc-1]). The value of argv[argc] is guaranteed to be 0.
body - The body of the main function
<h3>&bull; Name Spaces syntax:</h3>
namespace ns_name { declarations }	(1)	
inline namespace ns_name { declarations }	(2)	(since C++11)
namespace { declarations }	(3)	
ns_name::name	(4)	
using namespace ns_name;	(5)	
using ns_name::name;	(6)	
namespace name = qualified-namespace ;	(7)	
namespace ns_name::name	(8)	(since C++17)

1) Named namespace definition for the namespace ns_name.
2) Inline namespace definition for the namespace ns_name. Declarations inside ns_name will be visible in its enclosing namespace.
3) Unnamed namespace definition. Its members have potential scope from their point of declaration to the end of the translation 
   unit, and have internal linkage.
4) Namespace names (along with class names) can appear on the left hand side of the scope resolution operator, as part of qualified 
   name lookup.
5) using-directive: From the point of view of unqualified name lookup of any name after a using-directive and until the end of the 
   scope in which it appears, every name from ns_name is visible as if it were declared in the nearest enclosing namespace which 
   contains both the using-directive and ns_name.
6) using-declaration: makes the symbol name from the namespace ns_name accessible for unqualified lookup as if declared in the
   same class scope, block scope, or namespace as where this using-declaration appears.
7) namespace-alias-definition: makes name a synonym for another namespace: see namespace alias
8) nested namespace definition: namespace A::B::C { is equivalent to namespace A { namespace B { namespace C {
