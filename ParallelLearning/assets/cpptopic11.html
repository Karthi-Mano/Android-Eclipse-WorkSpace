To perform file processing in C++, header files <iostream> and <fstream> must be included in your C++ source file.
<h3>&bull;Opening a File:</h3>
A file must be opened before you can read from it or write to it. Either the ofstream or fstream object may be used to open a file for writing and ifstream object is used to open a file for reading purpose only.
<h3>&bull;Closing a File</h3>
When a C++ program terminates it automatically closes flushes all the streams, release all the allocated memory and close all the opened files. But it is always a good practice that a programmer should close all the opened files before program termination.
<h3>&bull;Writing to a File</h3>
While doing C++ programming, you write information to a file from your program using the stream insertion operator (<<) just as you use that operator to output information to the screen. The only difference is that you use an ofstream or fstream object instead of the cout object.
<h3>&bull;Reading from a File</h3>
You read information from a file into your program using the stream extraction operator (>>) just as you use that operator to input information from the keyboard. The only difference is that you use an ifstream or fstream object instead of the cin object.
