<h4>Classes:</h4>
<pre><p>&bull;A class is the blueprint from which the individual objects are created.</p>
<p>&bull; Class is composed of three things: a name, attributes, and operations.</p>
public class Student
{
}
According to the sample given below we can say that the Student object, named objectStudent, has been created out of the Student class.
Student objectStudent = new Student();
</pre>
<h4>Object</h4>
<p>&bull;An object can be considered a "thing" that can perform a set of related activities.</p>
<p>&bull; The set of activities that the object performs defines the object's behavior.</p>
<p>&bull; For example, the Hand (object) can grip something, or a Student (object) can give their name or address.</p>
<p>&bull;In pure OOP terms an object is an instance of a class.</p>
