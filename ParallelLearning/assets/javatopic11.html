<p>The java.io package contains nearly every class you might ever need to perform input and output (I/O) in Java. All these streams represent an input source and an output destination. The stream in the java.io package supports many data such as primitives, object, localized characters, etc.
Stream can be defined as a sequence of data. There are two kinds of Streams</p>
<p><b>InPutStream</b> − The InputStream is used to read data from a source.
<b>OutPutStream</b> − The OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination.</p>
 <p>The InputStream is used to read data from a source and the OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination.</p>
<h4>&bull;FileInputStream</h4>
<p>This stream is used for reading data from the files. Objects can be created using the keyword new and there are several types of constructors available.</p>
<h4>&bull;FileOutputStream</h4>
<p>FileOutputStream is used to create a file and write data into it. The stream would create a file, if it doesn't already exist, before opening it for output.</p>
